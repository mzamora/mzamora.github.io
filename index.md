## Hello world
I'm an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the [University of Chile](http://www.dimec.uchile.cl). My current research is related to Stratocumulus clouds modeling for coastal cities, motivated by solar forecasting applications. I'm interested in renewable energy applications, sustainable cities, as well as fluid dynamics and turbulence. [More on research](research.md), [teaching](teaching.md) and [some useful resources](resources.md).

I also currently work for the [Center of Acceleration of Sustainable Electromobility](https://centroelectromovilidad.cl/) (CASE), and I'm one of the South America regional representatives of the [Young Earth System Scientist Community](https://www.yess-community.org/aboutus/structure/regional-representatives/) (YESS).

I worked on my PhD at the Solar Resource Assessment and Forecasting Lab at [UC San Diego](http://solar.ucsd.edu) under the supervision of Prof. Jan Kleissl. I'm also a professional engineer from Chile, where I worked at the [FCFM Energy Center](http://www.centroenergia.cl) for three years. I'm a human being and I have a political and moral view that usually impact what I do and how I work.

## Some interests
* Cloud modeling and solar resource for energy production
* Fluid dynamics and turbulence
* Distributed renewable energy technologies
* Energy access and technology impact on societies
* Open source hardware and [distributed manufacturing](https://medium.com/@monicazamoraz/the-time-for-distributed-manufacturing-c2bb52817c3c)
* Technology for the rural world
