## Hello world
I'm a recent PhD in Engineering Sciences, working on Stratocumulus clouds modeling for coastal cities like San Diego, CA. [More on research](research.md), [teaching](teaching.md) and [some useful resources](resources.md).

I worked in my PhD at the Solar Resource Assessment and Forecasting Lab in [UC San Diego](http://solar.ucsd.edu). I'm also a professional engineer from Chile, where I worked at the [FCFM Energy Center](http://www.centroenergia.cl) for three years. Currently transitioning to start working at the [University of Chile](http://www.dimec.uchile.cl). I'm a human being and I have a political and moral view that usually impact what I do and how I work.

## Some interests
* Cloud modeling and solar resource for energy production
* Fluid dynamics and turbulence
* Distributed renewable energy technologies
* Energy access and technology impact on societies
* Open source hardware and [distributed manufacturing](https://medium.com/@monicazamoraz/the-time-for-distributed-manufacturing-c2bb52817c3c)
