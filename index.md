## Hello world
I'm a PhD student in mechanical engineering working in the solar energy forecasting area at [UCSD](http://solar.ucsd.edu). Currently I'm working on Stratocumulus clouds modeling, using realistic conditions for cities like San Diego, CA. [More on research](research.md), [teaching](teaching.md) and [some useful resources](resources.md).

I'm a professional engineer from Chile, where I worked at the [FCFM Energy Center](http://www.centroenergia.cl) for three years. When I'm done with grad school, I'll go back home and work at the [University of Chile](http://www.dimec.uchile.cl). I'm also a human being and have a political and moral view that usually impact what I do and how I work.

## Some interests
* Cloud modeling and solar resource for energy production
* Fluid dynamics and turbulence
* Distributed renewable energy technologies
* Energy access and technology impact on societies
* Open source hardware
